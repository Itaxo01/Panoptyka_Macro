# Panoptyka_Macro
A macro for the game Panoptyka. It just (hopefully) scans the screen on background and perform some simple actions on the game 

The code in this project will be entirely coded by myself, in order do learn a bit of OpenCV for the imagem manipulation and processing and also system inputs

The ambition is to get a executable capable of running on background on both linux and windows very fast.

### Log
(25/02/2026) Just set the initial project organization, and made the WindowManager to gather the window of the application using X11 (For now, I will develop it just for the linux, later on I think about the microsoft windows too). Wayland could be an option but it would be a lot more troublesome, but I got it that it's better in terms of security (which is a thing I don't need and definitely don't want as I need my program to spy on others).
