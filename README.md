# Panoptyka_Macro
A macro for the game Panoptyka. It just (hopefully) scans the screen on background and perform some simple actions on the game 

The code in this project will be entirely coded by myself, in order do learn a bit of OpenCV for the imagem manipulation and processing and also system inputs

The ambition is to get a executable capable of running on background on both linux and windows very fast.
